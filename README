Slides for the Introduction to Concurrency talk given at Mixrank
26 January 2015 to Types, Theorems, and Programming Languages.

The talk was originally billed on meetup.com as "Introducing the
Process Calculi: Formalisms for Concurrency", but there were a
few too many process calculi to properly introduce them all.
